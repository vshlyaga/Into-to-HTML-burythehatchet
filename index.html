<body>

  <h1>Montevideo</h1>
  <p>According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108
    (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square
    kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo
    is situated in the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern
    bank of the Río de la Plata.
  <p>The city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mauricio_de_Zabala">Bruno Mauricio de Zabala</a>,
    as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region.
    It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo hosted all the matches during
    the first FIFA World Cup. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of
    Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America’s leading trade blocs, position that entailed comparisons
    to the role of Brussels in Europe.
  
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>Between 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the
    region across the bay from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires">Buenos Aires</a>.
    This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, 
    when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around
    Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of
    Portugal built the Montevieu fort.
  <p>A Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor 
    of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the
    Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with 
    six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving 
    from the Canary Islands who were called by the locals "guanches", "guanchos" or
    "canarios". There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name 
    of Jorge Burgues.
  
  <h3>Climate</h3>
  <p>Montevideo enjoys a mild humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the Köppen
    climate classification). The city has cool winters (June to September), hot summers
    (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous
    thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout
    the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).
